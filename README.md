# VAHAKA - Electric Scooter Simulator for Automotive Cybersecurity Practice

## üö¶ About VAHAKA

The name **VAHAKA** (‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§ï) is derived from ancient Indian Sanskrit manuscripts, where it means **"carrier" or "vehicle"**. The term symbolizes a medium of movement‚Äîperfectly aligning with our mission to offer a dynamic and educational platform for exploring mobility-related cybersecurity threats and defenses.

VAHAKA is designed to replicate the key electronic and communication features of modern electric scooters. It provides a realistic and extensible environment for simulating various attack scenarios.

## üîç Key Features

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
### Prerequisites : 
To successfully install and run Vahaka on your Linux system, you need to have :
- NodeJS (at-least version 22.13.1)
- NPM (at-least version 11.1.0)
Note :
- If your system does not have NodeJS installed, the installation script attempts to install the latest version of Node on your system, but if your system already has a lower, unsupported version of Node - the installation script will NOT try to update it (since it can affect your other projects). In this case, you will have to manually update Node and NPM.
- Vahaka might run on Node versions earlier to the mentioned minimums, but this is not guaranteed.
### Method 1 - Using Installation Script
*(Creates a symlink)*
- Run this command in your Linux terminal : 
```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmynaSec-Research-Labs/Vahaka/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```
- Once installation is successful, start Vahaka from anywhere using the command 
```bash
vahaka
```

### Method 2 - Cloning the Repo
*(Creates no symlink, but you need to be in the Vahaka directory to run)*
- Clone the repository at your desired location :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmynaSec-Research-Labs/Vahaka.git
```
*(Or download and extract the .ZIP file)*
- Start Vahaka by entering into the directory and running :
```bash
node server.js
```
